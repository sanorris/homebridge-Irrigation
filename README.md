# homebridge-Irrigation


This is a work in progress.  I'm planning to create a Raspberry Pi driven irrigation controller.  It will be generic in that it doesn't depend on any specific brands of irrigation parts or relay boards.

It will simply use the GPIO pins of the raspberry pi to control relays that will allow me to turn the irrigation valves on and off.  By using Homebridge, I plan to be able to control and schedule the irrigation using Apple's Home app and even use Siri commands.
